# AI_game README

# This game requires an OpenAI API key to run.
Paste your API key to the line: openai.api_key = ""

For more information or to access your API keys, look here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

This program will create new files to write the games to. To prevent a mess, put the program files into their own folder before you run it.

This is a work in progress and does not always function as intended due to the variability in AI responses.
