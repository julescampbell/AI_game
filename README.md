# AI_game README

# This game requires an OpenAI API key to run.

This program will create new files to write the games to. To prevent a mess, put the program files into their own folder before you run it.


There is a demo of this program which can be viewed here: 

stepByStep.py is the first program in the video which generates the story as you chose options.

aiGame.py is the second program in the video which generates the storyline and writes a python game to match it.


This is a work in progress and does not always function as intended due to the variability in AI responses.
